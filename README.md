# levelGroundWireFrame
This is a build of a wireframe created for a MMA website called Level Ground. The wireframe is not my design, but the challenge was to recreate it as best as possible, and make it responsive. 

## How it's Made:

This site is made using HTML5 and CSS3. It uses media queries and other CSS features to create a more responsive site.

## What I Learned:

My goal for this wireframe was to create a fully responsive site, and play around with fluid and responsive methods.

I took the opportunity to get more practice with the rem and em units & learning about the :root element.

I also practiced with the use of media queries to make the site fully responsive for an array of device sizes.
